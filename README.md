OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO Project Description:

Use an Arduino board to control an LED (Light Emitting Diode)
Program the Arduino to blink the LED at a specified interval
Understand the basics of Arduino programming and electronics
Components:

Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, or Mega)
LED (any color)
Resistor (optional, but recommended)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Software:

Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Objective:

Learn basic Arduino programming concepts
Understand how to control digital outputs (like LEDs)
Practice using the Arduino IDE and writing simple code
Code Overview:

pinMode() function to set the LED pin as an output
Use the digitalWrite() function to turn the LED on and off
Use the delay() function to create a blinking effect
Example Code:

c++ const int ledPin = 13; // Choose a pin for the LED

void setup() { pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); }

void loop() { digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn on the LED delay(1000); // Wait 1 second digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn off the LED delay(1000); // Wait 1 second }

Tips and Variations:

Use different LED colors or add multiple LEDs
Change the blinking interval or pattern
Add a button or sensor to control the LED
Experiment with other Arduino functions and libraries
This project is a great starting point for beginners, and it's a lot of fun! If you have any questions or need help with the project, feel free to ask.README
